				<h1>CRITICAL REFORMS THROUGH EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT</h1>
				<p>IGC's work on effective government is borne out of the work done by the Africa Governance Initiative and Tony Blair Associates – Government Advisory from 2008 until 2017. This work had at its heart the founding principle that effective government can change lives.</p>

				<p>Over the last decade our work has shown this to be true. So far our work with government leaders has resulted in dramatic improvements in the lives of millions of poor people in the areas of access to health services, education, financial services, and electricity. </p>
				<p>But globalisation is not working for too many people. Despite living in a period of unprecedented wealth and potential, for almost a billion men, women, and children there is still no promise of a job to call their own, a roof over their heads, food on their tables, or basic healthcare and education. </p>
				<p>Governments will play a critical role in making globalisation work. They manage the economy, secure foreign investment, and oversee basic services. They shape how societies react to migration, adapt to new technologies and deal with threats like extremism.  </p>

				<p>Our work focuses on the centre of government and is shaped by national priorities. It includes economic development and inclusive growth, job creation, modernising infrastructure, public service reforms, strategic communications and government innovations. </p>
				<p>We work with governments and leaders of fragile, developing and emerging states to enhance their effectiveness. For those countries in the midst of vital transitions, effective government will be a key factor in determining success or failure. We support this by working shoulder to shoulder with our partner governments in pursuit of economic development that drives poverty reduction, improves livelihoods and enables peaceful transitions.</p>
				<p>In the last decade, we have worked in 20 countries across the world and currently as IGC we now have projects in eight African countries as well as teams working in Eastern Europe and Asia. In 2017, in response to demand, we are looking to expand this portfolio and enhance awareness and understanding of the critical role of effective government in driving development.</p>
