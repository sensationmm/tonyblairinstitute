				<p>The Tony Blair Institute for Global Change is a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to making globalisation work for the many, not the few.</p>
				<p>We offer new thinking and new approaches to addressing some of the most intractable problems leaders today are wrestling with.

				<p>We offer new thinking and new approaches to addressing some of the most intractable problems leaders today are wrestling with.
				 </p>
				<p>The Institute works to provide policy and strategy in support of a vision of globalisation designed to improve the well-being of the people, economically, politically and socially.  Our focus is on tackling the big challenges which hold such a vision of globalisation back:</p>
				<p>Poor governance which stops the benefits of globalisation being shared because countries cannot build the institutional strength and resilience to transform their situation and deliver for their people.</p>
				<p>Extremism which stops the cultural open-mindedness essential for social integration and commerce.</p>
				<p>Conflict which entrenches sectarianism and paralyses progress, particularly in the Middle East.</p>
				<p>Western politics which is in urgent need of a new policy agenda to provide radical but sensible answers to the new challenges presented by globalisation, technology and the rise of a new false populism.</p>

				<h2>Tony Blair</h2>
				<h3>Executive Director of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change Former Prime Minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</h3>
				<p>Tony Blair served as Prime Minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from 1997 to 2007, the only Labour leader in the party’s 100 year history to win three consecutive elections.</p>
				<p>During his time in office, the UK economy enjoyed record growth. His government made major improvements in Britain’s public services, particularly healthcare and education, through a programme of investment and reform. Britain’s first ever statutory minimum wage was introduced. The Prime Minister led the successful London 2012 Olympics bid; and oversaw the peace process for Northern Ireland. He introduced the first elected Mayor for London, the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>

				<p>He was a staunch advocate of an interventionist foreign policy, in particular in Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and Iraq. He trebled the UK’s aid programme for Africa and introduced the first environmental programme in the UK to combat climate change.</p>
				<p>Since leaving office Tony Blair has spent most of his time working on three areas: supporting governments to deliver effectively for their people, increased stability in the middle east and countering extremism. To build on this work, he founded the Tony Blair Institute of Global Change in 2017. This not-for-profit organisation is focused on ensuring that globalisation can be a force for good, that creates prosperity and reduces inequality, and thereby works for the many, rather than the few.</p>
